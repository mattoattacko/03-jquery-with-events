# Lab 3: jQuery with Events

**Author**: Chris K & Matt M 
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
Our team wanted to add the ability for the user to filter articles by both author and category. However, in order to reduce screen clutter, we wanted the articles to only display the first two elements w/ the ability to view more of the article via a "read on" button that displays the rest of the articles content. Users are also able to browse the page via tab-based event navigation. 

## Getting Started
Run live server from root directory.

## Architecture
This application uses jQuery to populate, sort, and filter blog entries.  jQuery selectors are used to find the template elements on the DOM and populates them with values stored in a JS object.  jQuery is also used to hide and show specific articles based on their author or category, and expands articles that the user chooses to read more of.
